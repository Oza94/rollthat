A TypeScript library to generate random stuff : numbers, strings and more. Also provide some utilities.

This library aims to be a "complete" toolset for [Procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation). I'm using it to generate content for tabletop RPGs. Therefore it includes lot of functionnality you might see in other packages but thanks to tree shaking and 0-dependencies, you _only pay for what you use_.

## Install

Via `npm install rollthat` or `yarn add rollthat`.
